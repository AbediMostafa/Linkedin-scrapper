# Lead Scraping & Outreach Automation System

## Overview
This project automates the process of scraping relevant job titles from LinkedIn based on companies and geographies submitted through a form, filtering the data based on experience and job seniority, retrieving contact details via Apollo.io, and pushing qualified leads to a Google Sheet and integrated outreach tools such as Instantly and AI calling/SMS systems.

## Objectives
1. Users submit a list of companies and country targets via a form.
2. System scrapes all relevant job titles from LinkedIn associated with those companies.
3. Users select the relevant titles via a second form.
4. The system retrieves individuals matching the selected job titles.
5. Contact information (emails, and optionally phone numbers) is fetched via [Apollo.io](https://www.apollo.io/).
6. Results are stored in a shared Google Sheet.
7. Leads are added to:
   - **Instantly** for automated emailing.
   - **AI caller tools** for SMS and voice call outreach.

## Key Features
- Filters for:
  - Country-specific employees.
  - People with **6-10+ years of total work experience** (not limited to current company).
  - Seniority levels: **CEO, CXO, Vice President, Principal, Director, Manager, Owner**.
  - **Former employees** must have left within the **last 5 years**.
- Integration with GPT to screen job titles for relevance.
- VLOOKUP on client domain:
  - If domain is found: scrape both **emails and phone numbers**.
  - If not found: scrape **emails only**.
- Two contact extraction options:
  - Option 1: Emails + phone numbers (if domain found).
  - Option 2: Emails only (fallback).
- High-speed scraping using:
  - **BeautifulSoup**, **Selenium**, **BrightData**, **Soax**, **Apify**, **ProxyCurl**, **Oxylabs**.
- Ability to process many requests simultaneously.
- AI-based engagement follow-up:
  - If no reply to email/SMS within 12 hours, initiate AI voice call.
